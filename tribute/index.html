      <p id="tribute-info"><a id="tribute-link" href="https://duolingo.fandom.com/wiki/Duo" target="_blank">Duo Keyshauna Renee Lingo</a> was a lovely owl who always encouraged learning, taught <i>espa√±ol</i>, and kidnapped families. He was born in 1000 BC, and lived an incredible 3024-year life until 2025. He worked at <a href="https://www.duolingo.com" target="_blank">Duolingo</a> for 13 years, which is where he died.</p>
      <p>Duo went viral on the internet for his aggression, and soon became famous as "The Duolingo Owl". He grew a large fanbase of avid language learners across the globe and gained many followers on his <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@duolingo" target="_blank">social media accounts</a>.</p>
      <p>But all good things come to an end. On February 11, 2025, Duolingo <a href="https://x.com/duolingo/status/1889328809054224698" target="_blank">announced Duo's death</a> on his <a href="https://x.com/duolingo/" target="_blank">Twitter/X</a> account. He was run over by a Tesla Cybertruck and unfortunately killed.</p>
      <p>During his lifetime, he made many friends and many enemies. (Luckily for him, his human-hunting skills helped him get rid of those enemies.) Overall, Duo was a great, well-loved owl. We were ‚Äì and still are ‚Äì sad to see him go.</p>
